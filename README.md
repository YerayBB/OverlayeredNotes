Tool to draw notes over everything.
The Installer contains the latest version, optimized to consume less while in background.

## [Manual](https://github.com/YerayBB/OverlayeredNotes/blob/master/Manual.pdf)

### Warnings
* Only works in Windows OS
* When the edit mode is off, the simplified menu arrow buttons will not work to close any opened section. This is due to the optimizations made to consume less.
